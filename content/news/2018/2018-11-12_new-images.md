New x86 and ARM images are now available that contain tons of updates
and fixes.

The x86 images come with multiple flavours:

- base-system
- Enlightenment
- Cinnamon
- Mate
- XFCE
- LXDE
- LXQt

As usual we also have a supply of ARM images including:

- BeagleBone/BeagleBone Black
- Cubieboard 2
- Odroid U2/U3
- RaspberryPi (ARMv6)
- RaspberryPi 2
- RaspberryPi 3

Void also comes in musl C flavors, which use the [musl C library](https://www.musl-libc.org/), 
a lightweight alternative to the popular glibc library.

Did you know you can run Void in the cloud?  We provide ready to
upload images for Google Cloud Platform that are compatible with the
always free tier!  You can also easily build images for other cloud
providers from our ready to run x64 tarballs.

Our rootfs tarballs can also be used anywhere you want a Void Linux
chroot and are available for all architectures we currently compile
for.

You can find all images and rootfs tarballs at
[https://alpha.de.repo.voidlinux.org/live/current](https://alpha.de.repo.voidlinux.org/live/current),
or in the /live/current directory on any mirror near you.
