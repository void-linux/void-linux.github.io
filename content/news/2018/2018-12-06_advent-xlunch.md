Sometimes its nice to have icons on the desktop, but desktops often
come with a lot of other software as part of a full desktop
environment that is not desirable for simple setups.

In cases such as these where a kiosk like experience is desired,
xlunch really shines.  The xlunch launcher is about as small as its
possible to get, depending on just Imlib2 and Xorg.  The basic idea is
to provide a grid of icons to click on and then launch whichever one
is clicked on.

Its also possible to use xlunch to create menu driven systems by
specifying alternate files for the icons and options, which will allow
you to quickly create graphical wizards with minimal effort.
