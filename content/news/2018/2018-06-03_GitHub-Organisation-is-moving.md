title="GitHub Organisation is moving"
date=2018-06-03
+++

So we're finally moving our GitHub Organisation. The new organisation name will
be [github.com/void-linux](https://github.com/void-linux).

We will move the organisation on **2018-06-15**.

This is a painful but important step in our reorganisation procedure and lays
the foundation of expanding our maintainer team.

#### Pull Requests

Beginning from that date, Void will only accept new pull requests for our new org.
New pull requests opened on the old organisation will be auto closed. The remaining pull
requests on the old organisation will remain open and will be handled, or the
author can reopen them on the new org.

#### Issues

We will add a comment to the remaining issues asking for them to be reopened
on the new organisation.

#### Domain

During the next few weeks the team will publish updates to point the repositories
to voidlinux.org instead of voidlinux.eu. We will publish a dedicated news entry
when the domain is ready to be used.

For everyone that manually configured a repository under the voidlinux.eu domain,
please change it manually.

The voidlinux.eu domain will continue to work, but we cannot give any promises
for how long.

At last we'd like to thank for the awesome support we're experiencing during our
restructuring.
