All Void managed mirrors now listen on new primary addresses.  The
default mirrors have been updated in the xbps package and will take
effect on your next system update.  If you were manually setting
mirrors, please take a few moments to update the hostname you have
configured.

Now is also a great time to determine if you're using the nearest
mirror.  An up-to-date list of mirrors and locations can be found any
time at
[http://auto.voidlinux.org/?mirrorstats](http://auto.voidlinux.org/?mirrorstats).

Please report issues at
