A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.53. This is a minor release
that contains bugfixes and performance improvements:

* xbps-rindex(1): fix possible stagedata deadlock. (<a href="https://twitter.com/Gottox">@Gottox</a>)

* xbps-create(1): Allow file paths longer than 128 characters. (<a href="https://twitter.com/Gottox">@Gottox</a>)

* libxbps: share workload more efficient between threads and avoid idling
  threads. (<a href="https://twitter.com/Gottox">@Gottox</a>)

* xbps-rindex(1): By default xbps-rindex will not check hashes while cleaning.
  To enable the old behavior the user can supply the --hashcheck flag.

This version also bumps the ABI version that should've happened with 0.52.
Sorry for that.
