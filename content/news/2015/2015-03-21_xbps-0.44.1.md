A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.44.1. This is a minor release
that contains bugfixes.

- libxbps: fixed `xbps_get_pkg_fulldeptree()` when a pkg depends on itself via
virtual packages. Reported by Duncan Overbrook.

- portableproplib: fixed a regression introduced in 0.44 resulting in EBADF
while internalizing plists.

- `xbps-uunshare(8`): does not fork and run cmd in the child process anymore,
replaces the execution environment with cmd instead.

- `xbps-uunshare(8)`: do not fail if we cannot disable setgroups; some kernels
might not support it. Found by Christian Neukirchen on 3.16.

- `xbps-reconfigure(8)`: added `-i/--ignore` to `usage()`, by Christian Neukirchen.

- Updated zsh completions, by Christian Neukirchen.

- `xbps-checkvers(8)`: fixed regression introduced in 0.44 adding packages
manually to the list as arguments.
