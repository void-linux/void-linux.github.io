A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.51. This is a minor release
that contains bugfixes:

* zsh completion: added `-U/--unpack-only` support for `xbps-install(1)`.

* libxbps: initialize locale to be able to unpack UTF-8 encoded
 packages files correctly with the musl C library.

* alternatives: preserve current order while updating packages.

* alternatives: always create the directory where the symlink is stored,
in case this does not exist yet.

* libxbps: another bugfix for conflicts: do not take into account packages
that are on hold mode.
