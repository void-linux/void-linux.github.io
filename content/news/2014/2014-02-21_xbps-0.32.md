A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.32. This is a bugfix
release that also implements two phase package removal (among other things):

Release notes:

- Fixed a bug in `xbps_pkgpattern_name()` where a string with some special
chars would result in a crash (reported by Gottox).

- Do the package removal in two phases: the first phase checks the
user has write permission to the entries being removed, if this
succeeds then the package removal is performed.

- xbps-remove(8): -O now also remove obsolete pkg signatures from
cachedir, and ignores pkgs of other architectures.

- xbps-rindex(8): set correct permissions to the POSIX semaphore
by clearing file permission bits before its creation.
