This page shows brief examples for common usage, refer to the manual pages for more information.

### Repositories

Repositories are the heart of the `xbps` package system. Repositories can be *locally* or *remotely*
available:

- *local*: repository is available in a local directory, e.g `/xbps/repository`.
- *remote*: repository is available in a remote location, e.g `http://my.domain.com/repository`.

Repositories can be declared in a file stored in `/etc/xbps.d` with a simple format:

```
repository=<url>
```

Where `url` can be a path to a directory (local) or an URL to the repository (remote):

```
# echo 'repository=/path/to/dir' > /etc/xbps.d/my-local-repo.conf
# echo 'repository=http://my.domain.com/repository' > /etc/xbps.d/my-remote-repo.conf
```

System repositories can be available at `/usr/share/xbps.d`, files bearing the same filename
available in `/etc/xbps.d` override those defined in `/usr/share/xbps.d`.

#### Official Repositories

- http://alpha.de.repo.voidlinux.org (EU: Germany *default*)
- http://beta.de.repo.voidlinux.org (EU: Germany)
- http://alpha.us.repo.voidlinux.org (USA: Kansas City)
- http://mirror.clarkson.edu/voidlinux/ (USA: New York)
- http://mirrors.servercentral.com/voidlinux/ (USA: Chicago)

You can find more about mirrors in the [Download page](https://voidlinux.org/download/#mirrors).

The official repositories (glibc) are signed with the following RSA key:

```
Signed-by: Void Linux
4096 60:ae:0c:d6:f0:95:17:80:bc:93:46:7a:89:af:a3:2d
```

You can print the `repository` RSA public key fingerprint with `xbps-query`:

```
$ xbps-query -vL
```

#### Official Repositories (musl)

Musl repositories are in the /current/musl directory of the [mirrors](https://voidlinux.org/download/#mirrors), e.g.
- http://alpha.de.repo.voidlinux.org/current/musl/ (EU: Germany)


The musl repositories are signed with the following RSA key:

```
Signed-by: Void Linux
4096 3d:b9:c0:50:41:a7:68:4c:2e:2c:a9:a2:5a:04:b7:3f
```

You can print the `repository` RSA public key fingerprint with `xbps-query`:

```
$ xbps-query -vL
```

#### Subrepositories

Additional sub repositories exist in the official repositories:

- debug (contains -dbg pkgs for debugging)
- nonfree (contains pkgs that don't have free licenses)
- multilib (contains 32bit pkgs for 64bit platforms)
- multilib/nonfree (contains non free 32bit pkgs for 64bit platforms)

Packages for these repositories exist in the `main` repository, i.e:

```
$ xbps-query -Rs void-repo
[*] void-repo-debug-5_1            Void Linux drop-in file for the debug repository
[*] void-repo-multilib-5_1         Void Linux drop-in file for the multilib repository
[*] void-repo-multilib-nonfree-5_1 Void Linux drop-in file for the multilib/nonfree repository
[*] void-repo-nonfree-5_1          Void Linux drop-in file for the nonfree repository
```

After installing any of them don't forget to synchronize the repository data:

```
# xbps-install -S
```

### xbps-install(1)

This utility can be used to install, update, reinstall, or downgrade a package,
or all packages in your system, and to syncronize the remote repositories data.

#### Synchronize remote repository data

```
# xbps-install -S
```

Remote repositories in xbps contain an archive that stores metadata of all
available packages in that repository. This data must be up-to-date. The `-S` flag
can be used with other mode to always sync.

#### Installing/updating a single package

```
# xbps-install -S pkg
```

If `pkg` is installed and there's a newer version, the package will be upgraded to
that version of the first repository containing it; otherwise the package will be installed.

#### Reinstalling/downgrading to a specific package version

```
# xbps-install -Sf pkg-1.0_1
```

By specifying a specific package version and the `-f` flag, the package will be reinstalled
or downgraded to that version if the package is currently installed.

#### Updating your system

```
# xbps-install -Su
```

This will update all currently installed packages to the latest version found in the
registered repositories, performing a global system update. This is the recommended command
to keep your system up to date daily.

### xbps-query(1)

This utility can be used to query for information about packages installed in your system
and in specific repositories.

The `xbps-query(1)` has two working modes:

- **Local**: shows information of packages installed in the rootdir
- **Repository**: shows information of packages stored in repositories

The `-R` or `--repository` option switches to the `repository` mode. Most options are able
to work in `local` and `repository` mode.

#### Listing registered repositories

```
$ xbps-query -L
```

#### Listing installed packages

```
$ xbps-query -l
```

#### Showing information for a package

```
$ xbps-query [-R] pkg
```

#### Showing the files list for a package

```
$ xbps-query [-R] -f pkg
```

#### Showing the required dependencies for a package

```
$ xbps-query [-R] -x pkg
```

#### Showing the reverse dependencies for a package (packages that depend on it):

```
$ xbps-query [-R] -X pkg
```

#### Searching for packages matching its package name/version and/or description

```
$ xbps-query [-R] -s pattern
```

#### Searching for packages matching a filename

```
$ xbps-query [-R] -o "*/filename"
```

### xbps-remove(1)

This utility can be used to remove installed packages and clean the cache directory.

#### Removing a single package

```
# xbps-remove pkg
```

#### Removing a single package and recursively all packages that were installed as dependencies

```
# xbps-remove -R pkg
```

#### Cleaning up the cache directory

```
# xbps-remove -O
```

#### Removing all package orphans

```
# xbps-remove -o
```

#### Removing all package orphans and clean the cache directory

```
# xbps-remove -Oo
```

### xbps-reconfigure(1)

This utility can be used to configure or force reconfiguration of an installed package.

When `xbps-install(1)` installs a package, it performs the task in two phases: *unpacking* and *configuration*.
The *unpacking* phase unpacks the package files of the binary package into disk, and the *configuration*
phase performs additional steps necessary to execute the software.

Packages that were not configured can be listed with `xbps-query -l` if its first two characters
are `uu`. In that case, those packages should be `reconfigured`:

```
# xbps-reconfigure -a
```

#### Configure a package that is in *unpacked* state

```
# xbps-reconfigure pkg
```

#### Configure all packages that are in *unpacked* state

```
# xbps-reconfigure -a
```

#### Force reconfiguration of a package (even if it was configured previously):

```
# xbps-reconfigure -f pkg
```


### xbps-pkgdb(1)

This utility can be used to report errors in installed packages, as well as changing some of its
properties.

#### Checking for errors in an installed package

```
# xbps-pkgdb pkg
```

If `pkg` does not have any error there won't be any output and return value will be 0.

#### Checking for errors in all installed packages

```
# xbps-pkgdb -a
```

#### Changing properties of an installed package

An installed package can have different modes depending how it was installed. If a package
was *explicitly* installed by the administrator and not as a *dependency*, its **installation** mode
will be set to **manual**, otherwise **auto**.

Packages that were installed manually can be listed with:

```
$ xbps-query -m
```

or per-package:

```
$ xbps-query -p automatic-install pkg
```

It's possible to change this mode with `xbps-pkgdb(1)`:

```
# xbps-pkgdb -m auto pkg
# xbps-pkgdb -m manual pkg
```

A package can also be put *on hold* mode to skip updates while performing a system update:

```
# xbps-pkgdb -m hold pkg
# xbps-pkgdb -m unhold pkg
```

A package can also be put in *repository locked mode* and will only be possible to update it
if there's an update in the same *repository* that was used for installing:

```
# xbps-pkgdb -m repolock pkg
# xbps-pkgdb -m repounlock pkg
```

### xbps-rindex(1)

This utility can be used to generate local repositories, remove obsolete binary packages stored
in them, and to sign the packages with a cryptographic key.

#### Creating a local repository

```
$ xbps-rindex -a /path/to/dir/*.xbps
```

Once the command has run, a local repository is available at `/path/to/dir` and can be used as an argument
to the `--repository` option or be declared in `/etc/xbps.d/`.

#### Adding a specific package to a repository

```
$ xbps-rindex -a /path/to/dir/foo-1.0_1.x86_64.xbps
```


#### Force addition of a specific package to a repository

```
$ xbps-rindex -f -a /path/to/dir/foo-1.0_1.x86_64.xbps
```

#### Cleaning a repository (removing stalled entries)

```
$ xbps-rindex -c /path/to/dir
```

#### Removing obsolete packages in a repository

```
$ xbps-rindex -r /path/to/dir
```

#### Signing a repository

Initialize the repository metadata with signing properties:

```
$ xbps-rindex --sign --signedby "I'm Groot" /path/to/dir
```

Signs all binary packages stored in repository with your specified RSA key.
If the `--privkey` argument not set, it defaults to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

```
$ xbps-rindex --signedby "I'm Groot" --sign-pkg /path/to/dir/*.xbps
```

### xbps-alternatives(1)

The `xbps-alternatives` utility lists or sets the alternatives provided by
installed packages.  Alternatives are classified by groups, and a group
contains a number of symbolic links which are applied when the group is
set.

#### List all alternatives

```
$ xbps-alternatives -l
```

#### List alternatives for a specific package

```
$ xbps-alternatives -l foo
```

#### Set all alternative groups

```
$ xbps-alternatives -s foo
```

#### Set specific alternative groups

```
$ xbps-alternatives -g bar -s foo
```
