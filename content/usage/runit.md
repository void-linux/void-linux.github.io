# Overview

runit is a suite of tools which include a PID 1 init as well as a
daemontools-compatible process supervision framework, along with utilities
which streamline creation and maintenance of services.

## Example Process Tree

Example of a basic running system with runit as PID 1

```
# pstree -a
runit
  `-runsvdir -P /run/runit/runsvdir/current...
      |-runsv dhcpcd-eth0
      |   `-dhcpcd -B eth0
      |-runsv sshd
      |   `-sshd -D
      |-runsv agetty-tty1
      |   `-agetty --noclear tty1 38400 linux
      |-runsv agetty-tty2
      |   `-agetty tty2 38400 linux
      |-runsv agetty-tty3
      |   `-agetty tty3 38400 linux
      |-runsv agetty-tty4
      |   `-agetty tty4 38400 linux
      |-runsv agetty-tty5
      |   `-agetty tty5 38400 linux
      |-runsv agetty-tty6
      |   `-agetty tty6 38400 linux
      `-runsv udevd
          `-udevd
```

Note how each service is managed by its own runsv process, further explanation below.

## Framework

runit employs a concept of a service directory, responsible for an individual service,
which is a process to monitor and an optional log service.

### void runit directories

- `/var/service` - always linked to the currently active runlevel
- `/etc/sv` - directory containing service files placed by xbps
- `/etc/runit/runsvdir` - directory containing all available runlevels

### Service Directory layout

A service directory requires only one file, an executable named `run` which is expected
to exec a process in the foreground. If the service directory contains a directory named
`log`, a pipe will be opened from the output of the `run` process in the service directory
to the input of the `run` process in the `log` directory.

The `sshd(8)` run service:


```
#!/bin/sh
ssh-keygen -A >/dev/null 2>&1 # Will generate host keys if they don't already exist
[ -r conf ] && . ./conf
exec /usr/sbin/sshd -D $OPTS 2>&1
```

will run the sshd process in the foreground, making sure all output (stderr, stdout) are directed
to stdout, which will be piped to the log below (`/etc/sv/sshd/log/run`):

```
#!/bin/sh
[ -d /var/log/sshd ] || mkdir -p /var/log/sshd
exec chpst -u root:adm svlogd -t /var/log/sshd
```

### User Commands

- `chpst(8)` - runit process environment manipulator
- `sv(8)` - runit utility to manage and inspect services
- `svlogd(8)` - runit logging utility
- `runsvchdir(8)` - runit "runlevel" switcher

### System Commands

- `runit(8)` - a UNIX process number 1
- `runsvdir(8)` - starts and monitors a collection of runsv(8) processes
- `runsv(8)` - starts and monitors a service and optionally an appendant log service


## Examples

System services require root access for most of these operations. Use `sudo(8)` with these
commands as a normal user for the desired system-level behavior.

### Service Status

To see the status of a supervised service use `sv s <service_name>`

for example,

```
# sv s sshd
```

returns

```
run: sshd: (pid 42) 1587s
```

To see the status of all services, use `sv s /var/service/*`.

### Stop/Start/Restart

Start a service

```
# sv u sshd
```

Stop a service

```
# sv d sshd
```

Restart a service

```
# sv t sshd
```

Each of these is a shortcut, for 'up', 'down', and 'terminate', respectively. Only the first letter
of each word is recognized (see `sv(8)`).

More verbose forms of the above

```
# sv start sshd
# sv stop sshd
# sv restart sshd
```

Each of these will also return the status of the service upon exit.

### Enabling a service

void-provided service directories live in `/etc/sv`. To enable a service in the current runlevel,
create a symlink from it to `/var/service`.

```
# ln -s /etc/sv/sshd /var/service/
```

Once a service is linked it will always start on boot and restart if it stops (unless administratively downed).

### Disabling a service

To disable a service in the current runlevel remove the symlink to its service directory from `/var/service`.

```
# rm /var/service/sshd
```

Removing the symlink will also stop the service.

## Run Levels

runit supports an unlimited amount of run levels, implemented as directories located under `/etc/runit/runsvdir/`.

The default runlevels shipped with void are `default` and `single`:

- The `single` runlevel is meant to be used as `rescue` or `single user` target and it will only start `sulogin(8)`
by default.
- The `default` runlevel will start `agetty(8)` and some more services; it's the `multi-user` target by default.

In order to create a new runlevel, it is best to start by copying this `default` and removing/adding
symlinks to service directories to create the runlevel you desire.

```
# cp -a /etc/runit/runsvdir/default /etc/runit/runsvdir/my_runlevel
# rm /etc/runit/runsvdir/my_runlevel/agetty-tty[3456] # remove all gettys except for tty1 and tty2
# ln -s /etc/sv/dcron /etc/runit/runsvdir/my_runlevel/ # add the cron service
```

To change the runlevel use the `runsvchdir(8)` command:

```
# runsvchdir my_runlevel
```

To make this runlevel the default runlevel, append it to your bootloader's kernel command line.

For GRUB edit `/etc/default/grub`, adding:
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=4 my_runlevel"
```

and rebuild the grub configuration file (`update-grub`)

Now your default runlevel will be `my_runlevel`.
