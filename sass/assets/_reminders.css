/* Nav Lists
************/

/*

* See: https://github.com/mozdevs/cssremedy/issues/15
*/

/*
* 1. Add zero-width-space to prevent VoiceOver disable
* 2. Absolute position ensures no extra space

*/
nav li:before {
  content: "\200B";
  position: absolute;

/* Reduced Motion
*****************/

/*
* 1. Immediately jump any animation to the end point
* 2. Remove transitions & fixed background attachment
* See: https://github.com/mozdevs/cssremedy/issues/11
*/

/* Line Heights
***************/

/*
* The default `normal` line-height is tightly spaced, but takes font-metrics into account.
* Looser spacing may improve readability, but may cause problems in some scripts.
* See: https://github.com/mozdevs/cssremedy/issues/7
