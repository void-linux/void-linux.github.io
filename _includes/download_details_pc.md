In addition to the plain command line image, there is a graphical flavor with the XFCE desktop environment.
Other graphical environments are fully supported by Void Linux, but are not offered as demonstration/installation
images, in order to decrease the overhead involved with testing.

Installable live images support a local installation (with the included packages) or a network installation (packages are downloaded from official repository).

You can log into these images as `anon` or `root`, and the password is `voidlinux`.

To start the installer, execute the `void-installer` utility with appropriate permissions (i.e., `sudo void-installer`).
