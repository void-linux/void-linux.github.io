## Download installable base live images and rootfs tarballs

All **live images** and **rootfs tarballs** are available at:

- [{{ site.download_mirror }}]({{ site.download_mirror }})

These files can also be downloaded from other mirrors, which are listed [in the documentation](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/repositories/mirrors/index.html).
Simply navigate to `live -> current` to find them.

The requirements for these images can be found [in the documentation](https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/index.html#base-system-requirements).
An internet connection via Ethernet or WiFi is required for network installation.

### Verifying file integrity and its digital signature

It is strongly recommended to validate the integrity and authenticity of any
downloaded image or tarball before using it, to ensure it hasnâ€™t been tampered
with. [Instructions on how to do
that](https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/index.html#verifying-images)
are provided in the [Void Handbook](https://docs.voidlinux.org/).
