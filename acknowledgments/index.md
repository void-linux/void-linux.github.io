# Acknowledging our Sponsors

Void is a project that stands upon the work of over 700 individual
contributors.  All of this work, however, needs to be transformed by
compilation into usable packages and system images for end users to
download and enjoy.  The build artifacts must then be mirrored and
served, and all of this infrastructure must be monitored and
maintained.  On this page we'd like to thank the organizations and
individuals that supply hardware for Void's use.

## [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

DigitalOcean sponsors a number of virtual machines which run various
infrastructure needs that support the rest of the fleet.  Their
support has enabled us to move non-build tasks off of build machines,
improving the reliability of these services and the resources
available for builds.

## [Enno Boland IT](https://ebo.land)

Enno Boland IT sponsors the glibc build machine, mail servers, and
root mirror.

## [Leah Neukirchen](http://leahneukirchen.org/)

Leah Neukirchen sponsors the aarch64 build machine.

## [Tj Vanderpoel](#)

Tj Vanderpoel sponsors the musl build machine.
