title: Void Accepted to Fastly Fast Forward!

Did you know that Void has over 20 mirrors?  We have mirrors all over
the world, but just having a bunch of servers isn't enough to
effectively deliver package updates to all Void users.  A mirror that
is nearby can have extremely good performance if you know it's there
and switch to it, but for many people what we would like to offer is
just a URL that works anywhere in the world to provide the best
download experience available in that location.  When you look at what
we're trying to achieve, its pretty clear we'd be trying to build a
content delivery network (CDN) for Void.

Rather than re-inventing the wheel, we reached out to the team at
Fastly to see if they'd be interested in working with us to improve
the default package experience for Void users globally.  We're excited
to announce that the answer is yes; Void has been accepted to the
Fastly [Fast Forward](https://www.fastly.com/fast-forward) program.
As part of this project, we'll be provisioning a new repo URL that
will retrieve packages via Fastly's global CDN.

Stay tuned over the next few weeks for the new mirror to become live,
and a post about how Void's mirror infrastructure works!
