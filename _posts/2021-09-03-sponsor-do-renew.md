Void is pleased to announce that DigitalOcean has renewed their
sponsorship of our project as part of the [Digital Ocean Open Source
program](https://www.digitalocean.com/open-source/).  DigitalOcean
provides us with reliable infrastructure on which we run the control
plane for our distributed fleet of machines, as well as some assorted
monitoring and fleet management services.  You can find our full list
of sponsors on the [Acknowledgements page](/acknowledgments/).

Should you also want to run a Void Linux VM on DigitalOcean's droplet
service, we provide tooling for generating Void Linux images in [the
mklive repository](https://github.com/void-linux/void-mklive).
