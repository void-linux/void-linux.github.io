It is my pleasure that from now on we'll start providing new x86 live images with
various Desktop Environments for testing. Those images are also known as `flavours`:

- Void live with Enlightenment (E19)
- Void live with MATE
- Void live with XFCE

Those images are generated automatically with the `void-mklive` script in 5 minutes
and will be created periodically with updated packages thanks to our continuous
package building available at [http://build.voidlinux.eu](http://build.voidlinux.eu).

The attached screenshot is my desktop with three `flavours` running at the same
time via `QEMU`:

Check the [downloads](http://www.voidlinux.eu/download/) section to grab them!

Don't forget to help us improving `Void` with your donations and/or contributions
to the `wiki`, `void-packages` or any available repository.
