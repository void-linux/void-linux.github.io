A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.50. This is a minor release
that contains bugfixes:

* libxbps: another bugfix for conflicts; do not take into account conflicts
in installed pkgs when the same pkg is in the transaction.

* `xbps-alternatives(1)`: symlinks are now always created relative to the
rootdir of the target file. Implemented by Enno Boland (@Gottox).

* libxbps: fixed a bug in package conflicts: ignore conflicts for packages
 that are going to be removed.

* `xbps-alternatives(1)`: dangling symlinks are now supported, because the
target directory is always created.

* Updated zsh completions, by Steve Prybylski.

* `xbps-checkvers(1)`: Joey Gouly has fixed bug [#120](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/120).

* libxbps: when configuring all packages ignore internal xbps objects of pkgdb.
 Fixes an assertion with `xbps-reconfigure -a`.
