A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.44. This is a major release
that contains new features, bugfixes and performance improvements.

Major highlights:

- `xbps-uunshare(8)`: new utility for xbps-src that uses Linux user namespaces
to perform the container setup.

- `xbps-pkgdb(8)`: added a new mode to set in installed packages: `repolock`.
If that mode is set with `-m repo(un)lock`, a package will only be updated
if there's an update in the same repository that was used for installing.
This implements [#77](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/77).

- `libxbps`: globally check for unresolved reverse dependencies and shared libraries
while installing/updating/removing packages.

And more... see the [NEWS](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/blob/master/NEWS) file
for more details.
