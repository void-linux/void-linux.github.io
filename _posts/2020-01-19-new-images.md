title: New images and new verification keys

We're pleased to announce that the 20191109 image set has been
promoted to current and is now generally available.

A change that comes along with these new images is the adoption of
`signify(1)` to verify images.  We're saying goodbye to PGP due to the
complexity involved, the relative difficulty in verifying the
resulting signature, and the questionable state of PGP key
distribution right now.

The downloads page has been updated with instructions for how you can
validate new images, and we hope you'll find this process easier and
faster than in previous releases.
