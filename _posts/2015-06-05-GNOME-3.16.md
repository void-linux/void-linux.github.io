While you guys can chill out at the pool our maintainers work hard to keep you
happy!  As a result we're proud to announce that the latest GNOME release has
just hit our official repositories.

Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/Gottox">Enno Boland</a> who put together
<a href="https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/pull/1765">this update</a>
containing about 140 commits and 76 package updates.
