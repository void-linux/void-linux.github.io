New x86 and ARM images are now available that contain tons of updates and fixes
for the installer (in both local and network modes), and finally this time we
were able to create images with the [musl libc](http://musl-libc.org).

The x86 images come with multiple flavours:

- base-system
- Enlightenment (E19)
- Cinnamon 2.6
- Mate 1.10
- XFCE 4.12
- LXDE

Our list of supported ARM platforms continues growing:

- BeagleBone/BeagleBone Black
- Cubieboard 2
- Odroid U2/U3
- RaspberryPi (ARMv6)
- RaspberryPi 2
- USB Armory

You can find all images and rootfs tarballs at [http://repo.voidlinux.org/live/current](http://repo.voidlinux.org/live/current)
