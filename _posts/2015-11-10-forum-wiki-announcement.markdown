For a while now we have used github for our wiki. We wanted to make contributing
to the wiki easier, and be able to make it look better. Since most users are
familiar with [mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) that is
what we went with. All of the existing content was imported into the new wiki,
and it is live at [wiki.voidlinux.org](https://wiki.voidlinux.org). Searching and
organization should be improved from the github experience. We look forward to
seeing new contributors and your feedback.

We are also taking this time to announce our new
[forums](https://forum.voidlinux.org). We hope to build a community here, users
can share screenshots, talk about their Void Linux setups, ask questions, and
more.

During this process we have started a new void-infrastructure team and we will
be publishing our [chef](https://chef.io) cookbooks and infrastructure code to
our new github organization [Void
Infrastructure](https://github.com/void-infrastructure). We currently have
a chef-server deployed, and are working to open source our existing cookbooks.
