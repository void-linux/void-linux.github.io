We're pleased to announce that the 20221001 image set has been promoted to
current and is now generally available.

You can find the new images on our [downloads page](/download/) and on our many
[mirrors](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/repositories/mirrors/index.html).

Special thanks for this image set goes out to [@CameronNemo](https://github.com/CameronNemo)
for work in fixing some of the issues with networking in the installer and
[@paper42](https://github.com/paper42) for various improvements to the live
image contents.

Also in this release, the Raspberry Pi platform images are now condensed into
one image per architecture. See [here](https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/guides/arm-devices/platforms.html#supported-models)
for more details about which image to use for which Raspberry Pi model.
