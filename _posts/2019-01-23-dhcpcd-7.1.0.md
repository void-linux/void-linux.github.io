title: "dhcpcd>=7.1.0 update may require manual intervention"

Starting with 7.1.0, the [dhcpcd(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/dhcpcd.8) package is dropping the `10-wpa_supplicant` hook.
Instead of the hook, upstream suggests to build [wpa_supplicant(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/wpa_supplicant.8) with
`CONFIG_MATCH_IFACE` enabled, this is done in the `wpa_supplicant` package since version `2.6_14`.

Users of the `10-wpa_supplicant` hook will need to adjust their systems to guarantee
that their wireless connection keeps working.

The following actions are required when [dhcpcd(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/dhcpcd.8) is updated to 7.1.0 for users of the 10-supplicant hook.

1. Make sure [wpa_supplicant(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/wpa_supplicant.8) is at least 2.6_14
2. [Enable](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/services/index.html) the [wpa_supplicant(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/wpa_supplicant.8) service.

Other users should be on the lookout as -M is now used to match all interfaces, using for configuration
the `CONF_FILE` variable. Setting an specific `WPA_INTERFACE` is now optional.
