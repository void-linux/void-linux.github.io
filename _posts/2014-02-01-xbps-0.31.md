A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.31. This is a major bugfix
release that fixes some concurrency issues in xbps-rindex(8) (among others):

Release notes:

- xbps-rindex(8): use a POSIX named semaphore in modes that can modify
repository data archive, to avoid concurrency issues.

- libxbps: fixed an issue with errno(3) propagation that lead to
ENOMEM errors when resolving dependencies.

- Removed 0.27 compat from repodata.

- If a repository has been signed previously respect its settings
in repodata (unless there were new changes). This allows us to
accomplish the following:

```
$ xbps-rindex repo/*.xbps
$ xbps-rindex --sign ... repo
$ xbps-rindex repo/new-pkg.xbps
```

 ... and repository is still signed after updating repodata.
 API/ABI incompatible changes, you've been warned :-)

- xbps-rindex(8): -c [clean] mode now is fully multithread safe.

-  Fixed a double free while downloading binpkgs from remote repositories
(reported by Hanspolo).
