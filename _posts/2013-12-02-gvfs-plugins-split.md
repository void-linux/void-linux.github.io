Starting with `gvfs-1.18.3_2` many of the provided plug-ins have been splitted
into additional binary packages:

 - gvfs-afp - Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) backend
 - gvfs-cdda - CD-ROM backend
 - gvfs-goa - Gnome Online Accounts (webservices) backend
 - gvfs-gphoto2 - gphoto2 (PTP camera/MTP media player) backend
 - gvfs-mtp - MTP backend
 - gvfs-smb - SMB/CIFS (Windows client) backend

Just install any of these plug-ins to have the same functionality as previously.
