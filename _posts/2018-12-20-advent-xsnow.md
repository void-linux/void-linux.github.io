If you're dreaming of a white christmas, dream no more with the quick
and easy installation of xsnow!

This small utility is best suited to window manager environments that
do not tile, and will cause snow to fall on your desktop.  The snow
will collect on top of your windows and you'll even have periodic
visits from Santa flying across your desktop.


Its a quick and fun utility, and worth a bit of Christmas cheer as we
go into the final days of the Void Advent.
