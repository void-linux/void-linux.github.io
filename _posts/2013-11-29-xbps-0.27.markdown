The latest XBPS stable version for 2013 is finally out: 0.27. This release contains
a big feature: RSA signed repositories. The official Void repositories have been
signed with a 4096bit RSA key specifically for this purpose.

The OpenSSH hexadecimal fingerprint of the RSA Void key is the following:
`60:ae:0c:d6:f0:95:17:80:bc:93:46:7a:89:af:a3:2d`.

After upgrading to that version you should be able to print repository details
via `xbps-query(8)`, i.e (Raspberry Pi output):


```
$ xbps-query -vL
 1783 http://xbps.nopcode.org/repos/current (RSA signed, verified)
      Signed-by: Void Linux
      4096 60:ae:0c:d6:f0:95:17:80:bc:93:46:7a:89:af:a3:2d
    2 http://xbps.nopcode.org/repos/current/nonfree (RSA signed, verified)
      Signed-by: Void Linux
      4096 60:ae:0c:d6:f0:95:17:80:bc:93:46:7a:89:af:a3:2d
$
```

Installing or updating packages from remote repositories will trigger a signature
verification, i.e:

```
# xbps-install -Syu
[*] Updating `http://xbps.nopcode.org/repos/current/armv6l-repodata' ...
[*] Updating `http://xbps.nopcode.org/repos/current/nonfree/armv6l-repodata' ...
[*] http://xbps.nopcode.org/repos/current: RSA signature verified
[*] http://xbps.nopcode.org/repos/current/nonfree: RSA signature verified
#
```

External RSA public keys can be imported via `xbps-install -S`; just make sure to verify
the validity of its fingerprint before accepting them blindly.

Release notes:

 - libxbps: make sure that base symlinks in the root directory are never removed,
   due to `/usr` switch in Void. This will also be harmless in other systems.

 - The testsuite now contains more tests than ever and will be extended as new
   issues appear.

 - Fixed [issue #20](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/20)

 - Fixed [issue #19](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/19)

 - Fixed [issue #18](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/18)

 - Fixed [issue #6](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/6)

 - `xbps-rindex(8)`: also understands the `XBPS_PASSPHRASE` environmental variable to
   supply the passphrase when signing repositories.

 - `xbps-rindex(8)`: added -v --verbose option.

 - Support for RSA signed repositories. A repository can be signed with your
   preferred RSA key (any ssh key works) as follows:

      `$ xbps-rindex --sign --signedby "foobar <foo@bar>" --privkey /priv/key /path/to/repo`

   If `--privkey` is not specified, it defaults to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

   Public keys must be imported before using external remote repositories via `xbps-install(8)`:

      `$ xbps-install -S`

   Starting from now on all remote repositories must be signed and verified.
   Local repos do not need to be signed and they will work as before.
