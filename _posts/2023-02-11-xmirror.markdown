title: New utility for selecting XBPS mirrors
layout: post

If you've ever had trouble [manually updating](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/repositories/mirrors/changing.html#manual-method)
the mirror XBPS uses, fear no more!
You can now use the [`xmirror(1)`](https://man.voidlinux.org/xmirror.1) utility from the `xmirror`
package to select a mirror, either interactively (by running `xmirror` with root privileges) or
directly using `xmirror --set`.

`xmirror` will make switching to the new [Fastly-sponsored mirror](https://voidlinux.org/news/2023/01/fastly-fast-forward.html)
extremely easy to do.
