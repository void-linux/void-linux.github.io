Starting with `base-files-0.92` a new group `xbuilder` with `gid 101` has been added
to the default `/etc/group` file.

If you are upgrading make sure to add this group manually to that file:

    # echo 'xbuilder:x:101:' >> /etc/group
    # grpconv

This group is now required to build packages with `xbps-src` so don't forget also to make your user a member of that group, i.e:

    $ usermod -a -G xbuilder <user>

and rebuild from scratch your `masterdir`:

    $ xbps-src zap; xbps-src binary-bootstrap
