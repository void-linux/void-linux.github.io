A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.40. This is a bugfix release.

Release notes:

- xbps-install(8): handle `xbps_transaction_prepare()` returning ENOSPC, to
abort a transaction when there's insufficient disk space on rootdir.

- xbps-query(8): `-S/--show` mode no longer prints ANSI escape codes if stdout
is not a tty; suggested by @chneukirchen.

- Reduced considerably memory requirement when checking SHA256 hashes on
files. Previous way of allocating heap memory as big as the file being
processed wasn't a great idea.

- xbps-{install,remove}: the post-install/pre-remove messages are now
printed with some guards, without the need to add them manually to the
{INSTALL,REMOVE}.msg files in binary packages:

```
==================================================================
 msg
==================================================================
```

- Fixed a heap overflow when printing post-install/pre-remove messages.
Noticed by Gottox.

- Updated zsh completion with more properties for xbps-query(8). Contributed
by Christian Neukirchen.

- Updated bash completion with more properties for xbps-query(8). Contributed
y Eivind Uggedal in [#58](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/58).
