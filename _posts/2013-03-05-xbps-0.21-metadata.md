Starting from today, the xbps-git package and the upcoming 0.21 version contains incompatible changes for the package database format (pkgdb). Please upgrade manually the xbps package (or xbps-git) and then use `xbps-pkgdb(8)` from 0.21 to update the metadata format.

Update the xbps or xbps-git package:

> If you've been using the `xbps-git` package remember to use the `-S` flag to sync the remote repository index files.

    # xbps-install -yu xbps

Update the pkgdb format:

    # xbps-pkgdb -u
    Conversion to 0.21 pkgdb format successfully

Resync the remote repository index files:

    # xbps-install -S

> The conversion must also be done in any masterdir being used by xbps-src.
