title: Void Linux freenode Channels Have Been Hijacked
layout: post
---

We have been made aware that during the mass channel takeover that is
ongoing on freenode that bogus `##voidlinux` and `##xbps` channels
have been created in the secondary namespace.

We do not operate or engage with these channels, and we do not
maintain an official presence on the freenode network.  We are still
in the process of finalizing the shutdown of the `#xbps` and
`#voidlinux` channels in the primary namespace, and have removed our
channels from the public listing as part of this process.

Though you should always exercise caution when running code obtained
from the internet, we urge you exercise extreme caution when using any
code from any channels on the freenode network that claims affiliation
with the Void Linux project.  You can always find our official points
of presence listed at the top of our [home page](/).

If you want to ask the Void team questions in real-time about this or
any other Void related matter, feel free to ask at any time in
`#voidlinux` on `irc.libera.chat`.
