A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.29. This is a minor bugfix
release that is fully compatible with *musl* C library.

Release notes:

- Added *XBPS_ARCH* environment variable to override tha native architecture
(uname(2) machine). This allows us to use "fake" architectures, for example
to use packages built for a different C library.

- Miscellaneous fixes to make XBPS work with the musl C library.

- Fixed [issue #27](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/27)
