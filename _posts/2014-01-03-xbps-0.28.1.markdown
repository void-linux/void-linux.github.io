A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.28.1. This release implements
per package RSA signatures (among other features).

Release notes:

- Implemented per package RSA signatures, replacing the repository index
signature from 0.27. There's now a `<binpkg>.sig` file with the RSA signature
for any pkg in a repository; the signature files are generated by `xbps-rindex(8)`.

- Implemented on-demand repository access: repositories are registered into
a private queue only on first access and not unconditionally.

- Fixed [issue #26](ttps://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/26)

- xbps-query(8): -o (local ownedby mode) does not print directories;
it's unnecessary anyway because xbps never extracts empty directories.

- The `--repository` option in xbps-install(8) and xbps-query(8) now adds
the repositories at the top of the list, rather than overriding the list
specified in a configuration file.

- Fixed [issue #25](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/25)

- Fixed [issue #24](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/24)
