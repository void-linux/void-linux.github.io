New x86 (32/64 bits) ISO live images are now available for public consumption.
All images (including the minimal one with **base-system**) now include the following
software:

- cryptsetup
- lvm2
- mdadm

The installer now has an option to not install the bootloader, if the user decides
to not install it. However, note that if you don't install the bootloader it's your
problem to update it.

Additionally there's now a new flavour containing the latest [Cinnamon](http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/)
Desktop Environment.

Check out the [Download](http://www.voidlinux.org/download/) section to grab them.
