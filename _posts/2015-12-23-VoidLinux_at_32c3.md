The 32nd Chaos Communication Congress (32C3) is an annual four-day conference on
technology, society, and utopia located in Hamburg/Germany. This is a great
opportunity for us to meet and get in touch with Void users.

If you want to learn about Void feel free to join our [assembly](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Assembly:VoidLinux).
