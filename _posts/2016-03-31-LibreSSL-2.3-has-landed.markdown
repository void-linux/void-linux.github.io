We're proud to announce that yet again we are the first and currently only Linux
distribution that ships [LibreSSL-2.3](http://www.libressl.org/) by default.

In the last two days we rebuilt the whole repository with LibreSSL-2.3. The
process took more than 24 hours and needed several fixes to various packages.
There are still some packages that link against the older LibreSSL-2.2 but the
will be fixed to use the latest LibreSSL within a few days.

Report any issues and thanks for using VoidLinux!
