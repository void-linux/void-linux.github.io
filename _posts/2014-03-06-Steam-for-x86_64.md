Valve's steam client is now available for x86\_64. Thanks to the recent improvements
made to xbps-src, we are now able to build 32bit pkgs for x86\_64 by reusing the
same unmodified build template files.

To install and run steam with Void on x86\_64, follow these steps:

    # Make sure that all pkgs are up-to-date.
    # xbps-install -Syu

Uncomment the *nonfree* repository from `/etc/xbps/xbps.conf`:

    http://repo.voidlinux.eu/current/nonfree

And then install steam and required 32bit packages:

    # Where XXX might be: amd, intel or nouveau.
    # xbps-install -Sy libGL-32bit libpulseaudio-32bit libtxc_dxtn-32bit mesa-XXX-dri-32bit steam
