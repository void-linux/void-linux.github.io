A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.36. This is a minor release
that contains a new utility `xbps-checkvers(8)` to be used by the XBPS source packages
collection (among other things).

Release notes:

- libxbps: the dependency solver is now able to detect and ignore invalid
dependencies of a package that are depending on itself, either as real
or virtual packages.

- xbps-uchroot(8): a manual page has been created.

- xbps-install(8): the -n,--dry-run option does not acquire the pkgdb file lock
anymore, so that any user can use this mode even without write permission to
the target pkgdb.

- xbps-query(8): fix a segfault with '-vL' for local unsigned repositories.

- xbps-create(8): new option --compression to specify a compression format;
defaults to xz.

- xbps-checkvers(8): new utility merged from https://github.com/xdave/xbps-src-utils
that is able to check which packages are outdated in the XBPS repositories or
a rootdir by comparing them against a xbps-packages repository.
 Written by xdave and improved by myself.
