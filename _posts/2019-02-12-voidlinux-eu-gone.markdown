title: VoidLinux.eu Is Not Ours
layout: post
---

We would like to warn people of a domain name that is no longer under Void
Linux control. `voidlinux.eu` lapsed in its original registration, and was
purchased by an unknown 3rd party before Void Linux could regain ownership. At
this time, please assume that anything involving `voidlinux.eu` is not related
to Void Linux, and should be considered potentially malicious. Of course, if
the person who owns the domain now would like to transfer it to our control,
we'd be grateful, and will update voidlinux.org to indicate if this happens.

Our official domain is VoidLinux.org.
