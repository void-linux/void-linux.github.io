A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.43. This is a minor release
that contains some bugfixes.

Release notes:

- pcc `>=` 1.1.0 is now a supported compiler.

- `xbps.d(5)`: the *virtualpkg* keyword now accepts pkgnames in the first component,
to match any virtual package version. Example:

	`virtualpkg=foo:bar`

      would match any version of the virtual package `foo` to be resolved as `bar`.

- libxbps: when resolving virtual packages in repositories, make sure to initialize
pkgdb to match any virtualpkg declared there. Regression introduced in 0.42.

- configure: build with `-fstack-protector-strong` if supported by the compiler,
and fallback to `-fstack-protector` otherwise.

- `xbps-pkgdb(8)`: the `packaged-with` string obj is removed from pkgdb.
Since 0.42 that object is unnecessary and is being obsoleted.

- libfetch: fix races in the cache connection code.

Happy new year 2015!
