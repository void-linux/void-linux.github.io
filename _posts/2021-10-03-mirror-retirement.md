title: US Mirror Retirement
layout: post

The alpha.us.repo.voidlinux.org mirror has been retired.  Users should
switch to https://repo-us.voidlinux.org for continued service out of
the central US.  As part of the switch the US tier one mirror has
gained TLS, and is running on a more reliable host.

All contributors with in-flight PRs should rebase to ensure that the
latest URL is reflected in your branch's CI configuration.
