A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.49. This is a minor release
that contains bugfixes:

* alternatives: relative symlinks are now supported. Contributed
by Joey Gouly in [#126](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/126).

* `xbps-alternatives(1)`: `-g <grp> -l` now works. To only print all alternatives
associated with this group.

* `xbps-remove(1)`: this now will print the messages from alternatives.

* alternatives: do not register duplicate alternative groups. Happened when
reinstalling a package with alternatives.
