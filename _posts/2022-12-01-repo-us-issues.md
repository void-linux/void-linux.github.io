title: US Mirror Issues

The US mirror, [repo-us.voidlinux.org](https://repo-us.voidlinux.org/), is currently having hardware issues and is no longer syncing with the other mirrors for the time being.
Until this is fixed, [switching to another mirror](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/repositories/mirrors/changing.html) is recommended.
There are [several other mirrors](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/repositories/mirrors/index.html) located in the US that are still operational.
