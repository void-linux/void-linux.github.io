The [latest rclone update](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/commit/c2f27e9a75169e6bdc67f420d5e8a12648a8d8f0)
to version 1.53.3 fixes
[CVE-2020-28924](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28924).
From the [release announcement](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-53-3-release/20569):

> Some passwords generated with rclone config may be insecure. In
> particular if you used the 'g' generate option with rclone
> v1.49 - v1.53.2 then your password will based on the second it was
> generated in. This means that there are fixed number of passwords
> in that period ~33 million.

We updated the rclone package to version 1.49.0, the first one affected,
on August 27, 2019. The upstream project recommends using their
[passwordcheck](https://github.com/rclone/passwordcheck) utility to verify
that your passwords aren't among the ~33 million vulnerable ones. On a
Void Linux system, you can obtain this utility by installing the `go`
package and then building `passwordcheck` locally:

```
# xbps-install -S go
$ go get github.com/rclone/passwordcheck
```
