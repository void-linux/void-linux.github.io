title: Repository Signing Disruption
layout: post
---

We are aware of an ongoing infrastructure issue affecting repository
synchronization and package signing.  We are working to resolve this
disruption, but first must resolve another unrelated infrastructure
issue.  We have no short term ETA for service restoration, however our
worst case resolution timeline is Friday the 23rd of July.

Your patience is appreciated while we perform this work as fast as
possible.
