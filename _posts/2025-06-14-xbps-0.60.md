## What's Changed

 * libxbps: fix issues with updating packages in unpacked state. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: run all scripts before and after unpacking all packages,
   to avoid running things in a half unpacked state. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: fix configuration parsing with missing trailing newline
   and remove trailing spaces from values. [eater](https://github.com/eater), [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: fix XBPS_ARCH environment variable if architecture
   is also defined in a configuration file. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: fix memory leaks. [ArsenArsen](https://github.com/ArsenArsen)

 * libxbps: fix file descriptor leaks. [gt7-void](https://github.com/gt7-void)

 * libxbps: fix temporary redirect in libfetch. [ericonr](https://github.com/ericonr)

 * libxbps: fix how the automatic/manual mode is set when replacing a
    package using replaces. This makes it possible to correctly replace
    manually installed packages using a transitional packages. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: fix inconsistent dependency resolution when a dependency
   is on hold. xbps will now exit with `ENODEV` (19) if a held dependency
   breaks the installation or update of a package instead of just ignoring
   it, resulting in an inconsistent pkgdb. [#393](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/393) [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: fix issues with `XBPS_FLAG_INSTALL_AUTO` where already installed
   packages would get marked automatically installed when they are being
   updated while installing new packages in automatically installed mode.
   [#557](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/557) [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: when reinstalling a package, don't remove directories that are still
   part of the new package. This avoids the recreation of directories which
   trips up runsv, as it keeps an fd to the service directory open that would
   be deleted and recreated. [#561](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/561) [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-install(1): list reinstalled packages. [chocimier](https://github.com/chocimier)

 * xbps-install(1): in dry-run mode, ignore out of space error. [chocimier](https://github.com/chocimier)

 * xbps-install(1): fix bug where a repo-locked dependency could be updated
   from a repository it was not locked to. [chocimier](https://github.com/chocimier)

 * xbps-fetch(1): make sure to exit with failure if a failure was encountered.
   [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-fetch(1): fix printing uninitialized memory in error cases. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-pkgdb(1): remove mtime checks, they are unreliable on fat filesystems
   and xbps does not rely on mtime matching the package anymore. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-checkvers(1): with --installed also list subpackages. [chocimier](https://github.com/chocimier)

 * xbps-remove(1): fix dry-run cache cleaning inconsistencies. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-remove(1): allow removing "uninstalled" packages (packages in the cache
   that are still up to date but no long installed) from the package
   cache by specifying the -O/--clean-cache flag twice. [#530](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/530) [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-query(1): --cat now works in either repo or pkgdb mode. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-query(1): --list-repos/-L list all repos including ones that
   fail to open. [chocimier](https://github.com/chocimier)

 * xbps.d(5): describe ignorepkg more precisely. [chocimier](https://github.com/chocimier)

 * libxbps, xbps-install(1), xbps-remove(1), xbps-reconfigure(1),
   xbps-alternatives(1): add `XBPS_SYSLOG` environment variable to overwrite
   syslog configuration option. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: Resolve performance issue caused by the growing number of virtual packages
   in the Void Linux repository. [#625](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/625) [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: Merge the staging data into the repository index (repodata) file.
   This allows downloading the staging index from remote repositories without
   having to keep the two index files in sync. [#575](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/575) [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-install(1), xbps-query(1), xbps-checkvers(1), xbps.d(5): Added `--staging` flag,
   `XBPS_STAGING` environment variable and `staging=true|false` configuration option.
   Enabling staging allows xbps to use staged packages from remote repositories.
   [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-install(1), xbps-remove(1): Print package install and removal messages once,
   below the transaction summary, before applying the transaction. [#572](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/572) [chocimier](https://github.com/chocimier)

 * xbps-query(1): Improved argument parsing allows package arguments anywhere in the
   arguments. [#588](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/588) [classabbyamp](https://github.com/classabbyamp)

 * xbps-install(1): Make dry-run output consistent/machine parsable. [#611](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/611) [classabbyamp](https://github.com/classabbyamp)

 * libxbps: Do not url-escape tilde character in path for better compatibility with
   some servers. [#607](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/607) [gmbeard](https://github.com/gmbeard)

 * libxbps: use the proper ASN1 signature type for packages. Signatures now have a `.sig2`
   extension. [#565](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/565) [classabbyamp](https://github.com/classabbyamp)

 * xbps-uhelper(1): add verbose output for `pkgmatch` and `cmpver` subcommands if the
   -v/--verbose flag is specified. [#549](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/549) [classabbyamp](https://github.com/classabbyamp)

 * xbps-uhelper(1): support multiple arguments for many subcommands to improve pipelined
   performance. [#536](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/536) [classabbyamp](https://github.com/classabbyamp)

 * xbps-alternatives(1): Add -R/--repository mode to -l/--list to show alternatives
   of packages in the repository. [#340](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/340) [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: fix permanent (308) redirects when fetching packages and repositories. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-remove(1): ignores file not found errors for files it deletes. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * libxbps: the `preserve` package metadata is now also respected for package removals. [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)

 * xbps-pkgdb(1): new --checks allows to choose which checks are run. [#352](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps/pull/352) [ericonr](https://github.com/ericonr), [duncaen](https://github.com/duncaen)
