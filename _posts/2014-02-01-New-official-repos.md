Thanks to Jan Schreib we now have a new build server to build all binary
packages in real time. This server is now the main official server to store
the binary package repositories.

XBPS 0.31 already contains the updated xbps.conf file with the new repository locations.

The URLs for the new repositories are the following:

- http://repo.voidlinux.eu/current
- http://repo.voidlinux.eu/current/nonfree

Happy xbps'ing!
