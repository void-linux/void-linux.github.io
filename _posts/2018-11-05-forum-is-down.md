The forum is down.

The forum has been generously operated by @gregf and is not a managed
Void resource, so we have no information as to when or if it will
return.  We have reached out to gregf to determine what has happened
and possible courses of action, and will provide updates as
information becomes available.

In the meantime, for Void Linux support, please explore the following
channels:

  * IRC
    * We have `#voidlinux` and `#xbps` on freenode
    * `#voidlinux` is for general support
    * `#xbps` is for development discussion
  * [The Wiki](http://wiki.voidlinux.eu)
    * The wiki is currently in maintenence mode, help us replace it at
      [the docs repo](https://github.com/void-linux/void-docs/)
  * StackExchange
    * Ask questions on [unix.stackexchange.com](https://unix.stackexchange.com)
    * Tag your questions with `void-linux`
  * Reddit
    * [r/voidlinux ](https://www.reddit.com/r/voidlinux)
    * Also not managed/moderated by the Void team, but very likely to
      be up!
