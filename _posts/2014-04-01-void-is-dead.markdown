This just to inform you that I'm declaring this project completely dead, and I have
lost all interest in continuing improving XBPS (the native package system) and
the Void Linux distribution as well.

I don't have enough motivation to maintain a complete and genuine package system,
that is not a fork and has been created exclusively by one human (Juan RP), that
is able to cross compile, supports multiple C libraries (glibc and musl),
supports build options, debugging packages, subpackages,
and uses [buildot](http://build.voidlinux.eu:8010/) to build them in real time.

Thanks for all your support, and enjoy your life. You can still use other distributions
such as [Biebian](http://biebian.sourceforge.net/), which contains genuine features:
an exclusive wallpaper of yours truly.
