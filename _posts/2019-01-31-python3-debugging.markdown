Void isn't all smooth sailing.  Sometimes things break in obscure and
difficult to troubleshoot ways.  This was recently the case when one
of our maintainers noticed that certain Python packages weren't
behaving as expected.  If you're curious about how this kind of
troubleshooting happens, [maxice8]'s blog post is highly recommended
as its a good intro into what its like to troubleshoot things from the
perspective of a Void maintainer.
