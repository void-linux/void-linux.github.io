A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.34. This is a minor release
that contains some exciting `xbps-query(8)` features (among other things).

Release notes:

- `xbps-query(8)`: search mode now accepts `-p/--property` argument to match patterns
against the stored package object in repositories. Any object stored in the repository
index can be used to be matched against to; the posibilities are countless:

	- find out what packages are mantained by a person
	- find out what packages are built at a specific date
	- find out what packages are linked to a specific shared library
	- etc etc etc

You can see some [examples](https://plus.google.com/106812073015308749022/posts/ats22UZk1WU).

- `xbps-query(8)`: in local mode now prints all objects stored on its pkgdb entry
and its metaplist.

- Fix [#34](https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps/issues/34)
(xbps-uhelper fetch fails to download files from https://alioth.debian.org).
The issue is that this HTTP server returns 406 (Not Acceptable) when the HTTP
header does not contain the "Accept" field (see
this [link for more info](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=712261)).
Our libfetch code now always adds `"Accept: */*"` in the HTTP headers.

- Added some debugging in error paths when performing a transaction.

- Fixed an issue where in a transaction a package with wrong version was being
configured resulting in ENOENT. The configure phase now only uses the package
name to perform the configuration rather than using package name/version tuple.

- Pass another argument to package scripts with the native machine architecture
(uname -m), which can be overrided via `XBPS_ARCH` environment variable too
