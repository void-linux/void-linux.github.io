2018 has been an intense year for Void. There were many ups and downs.
To wrap up the year we're meeting at the [35c3](https://events.ccc.de/category/congress/35c3/).

To meet other Voiders and chat about related and unrelated topics there's
the
[**Void Linux Assembly**](https://signup.c3assemblies.de/assembly/cf15ba5d-5bb1-473d-827c-b83862de75a1)

Also, on day 1 (2018-12-27) 19:00, [@Gottox](https://twitter.com/Gottox) is doing his
annual talk about [**The State Of the
Void**](https://pretalx.35c3oio.freifunk.space/35c3oio/talk/XCU9PD/).

After the talk, around 20:00, Void is inviting you to a **Void User Meetup**. We'll
meet at the Open Infrastructure Orbit in front of the lecture area, find the
nearest bar, grab a Beer or a Tschunk, and get into interesting conversations.

I'm looking forward to a great event with an awesome community!
