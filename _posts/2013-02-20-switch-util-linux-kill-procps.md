coreutils-8.21_3 does not provide the kill(1) and uptime(1) commands anymore. We now use util-linux kill(1) and procps-ng uptime(1). When upgrading there may be some conflicts as shown below:

    # xbps-install -Syu
    Conflicting packages were found:
     util-linux-2.22.2_7 conflicts with installed pkg coreutils-8.21_2
     procps-ng-3.3.5_4 conflicts with installed pkg coreutils-8.21_2

Which can be fixed by updating coreutils before running a full upgrade:

    # xbps-install -Syu coreutils
    # xbps-install -Syu
