A tool with many uses is [pv(1)](https://man.voidlinux.eu/pv.1), the
'pipe viewer'.  Essentially, you can put it between any pipe and
you'll see statistics on its throughput.

For example, we can measure the speed of `/dev/urandom`:

```
% pv < /dev/urandom > /dev/null
168MiB 0:00:01 [ 167MiB/s] [<=>                                               ]
```

Or look how fast we can extract a tar.xz file:

```
% xzcat big.xz | pv | tar xf -
```

Or copy a whole disk to a remote host, with a progress bar:

```
# dd if=/dev/sdb | pv | ssh me@remote dd of=/dev/sdc
```

`pv` has a few nifty flags, for example, it also can count
*lines* instead of bytes.  So we can build a progress bar for
a [find](https://man.voidlinux.eu/find.1)/[xargs](https://man.voidlinux.eu/xargs.1) call
(or rather,
[lr](https://man.voidlinux.eu/lr.1)/
[xe](https://man.voidlinux.eu/xe.1)):

```
% find /tmp -name '*.png' | pv -l | xargs -P4 -n1 pngcrush -ow
```

(Or even better, use `find -print0` and `pv -0`.)

Finally, `pv` also can limit the bandwidth, which can be useful if you
want to limit transfer rates to lower strain on the system, for example,
and buffer the input, which is useful to ensure a consistent write rate.
