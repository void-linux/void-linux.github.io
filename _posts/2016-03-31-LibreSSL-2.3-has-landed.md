We're proud to announce that yet again we are the first and currently only Linux
distribution that ships [LibreSSL-2.3](http://www.libressl.org/) by default.

In the last two days we rebuilt the whole repository with LibreSSL-2.3. The
process took more than 24 hours and involved several fixes to packages that
were not initially LibreSSL-2.3 compatible. There are still some packages that
link against the older LibreSSL-2.2 but they will be fixed to use the latest
LibreSSL within a few days.

Report any issues and thanks for using VoidLinux!
