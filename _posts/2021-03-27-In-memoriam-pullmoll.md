Today, we were informed that our long time contributor and maintainer Jürgen
Buchmüller (pullmoll) has passed away.

With boundless dedication, Jürgen was one of the most prolific contributors to
the Void project and sponsored the project financially, too.

He invested lots of his time in keeping GCC up to date and well tested, supplied tons of
patches to port packages to new compilers and platforms and also took care of
(co-)maintaining many packages, including several non-trivial ones, like OpenJDK
and LibreOffice.

He was not only a dedicated and driven developer in the Void Linux project, he
also was one of the friendliest and warmest people we had the pleasure to work
with. Jürgen will be missed as a steady force and a calm and wise voice in
discussions. Most of all, he will be remembered as a friend to all of us.

Our thoughts and condolences go out to Jürgen's family, friends, and loved ones.

**Thank you, pullmoll.**

-- The Void Linux maintainers
