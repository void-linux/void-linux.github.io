Starting with XBPS 0.25, the repository format has been changed to a single compressed file.
This will cause troubles if you are upgrading from an old version, and you will encounter
errors with missing packages when installing and/or upgrading.

Therefore you must update XBPS before continuing to avoid the missing package errors:

    $ xbps-install -Su xbps

> This will update XBPS to the latest stable version stored in the old repository format.

After upgrading XBPS to `>=0.25` you can safely install and upgrade packages normally.
