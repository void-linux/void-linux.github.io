title: "The Advent of Void: Day 4: containers"

Today we introduce [containers](https://github.com/arachsys/containers) a small suite of tools to create and run programs in "containers" using linux namespaces.

The `containers` package leverages the same kernel features as Docker and LXC, but those pieces of software are large and provide many features not directly related to container technology itself. `containers` only does the bare minimum.

`containers` comes with three tools: `contain`, `pseudo` and `inject`.

`contain` handles the details of running `init` (or `/bin/sh` if no init is specified). Inside its container, `contain` is the computer, much like the lxc or docker daemons.

`pseudo` uses `CLONE_NEWUSER` to create a `user namespace` which makes it possible to map UIDs and GIDs from inside the namespaces to real UIDs and GIDs outside the namespace.

`inject` is used to run a new programm in a running container, like spawning a shell to configure the container form inside.

To setup a small void container we run `xbps-install` with `pseudo` to populate a directory with a base system where files that are usually owned by root are owned by our user outside the namespace. Inside the namespace they will appear as if those files are owned by root.

```
$ pseudo xbps-install -R https://repo.voidlinux.eu/current/ -MSr /tmp/void base-voidstrap

With the populated root directory we can already use contain to run a shell inside our container.

```
$ id
uid=1000([...]) gid=1000([...]) groups=[...]
$ contain /tmp/void/
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Before we "boot" the void container, we disable the agetty services, because we don't need them and they would just restart in a loop, because the ttys are not available.

```
$ rm /tmp/void/etc/runit/runsvdir/default/agetty*
```

Now we can copy our hosts `/etc/resolv.conf` into the containers root simplify the setup.
To share the host network unprivileged with the container we can use the `-n` flag.
By default contain runs a shell inside of the container, to "boot" the container we specify `/bin/init`.

```
$ cp /etc/resolv.conf /tmp/void/etc/
$ contain -n /tmp/void/ /bin/init
- runit: $Id: 25da3b86f7bed4038b8a039d2f8e8c9bbcf0822b $: booting.

```

While the container is running we can use the `inject` tool to enter the namespace.

```
$ sudo inject $(pgrep contain) /bin/bash
bash-4.4# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
bash-4.4# ip link

```

The functionality of `contain` can be further extended with two flags: `-i` to run a program inside of the namespace and `-o` to run a program outside of the namespace.

As example we can use the `-i` flag to bind mount a directory into the namespace

```
$ contain -i "mkdir data; mount --bind $(pwd) data" -n /tmp/void/ /bin/init
[...]
$ sudo inject $(pgrep contain) /bin/bash
bash-4.4# ls /data/
hello  world
bash-4.4#
```

Instead of passing the shell commands to `-i` and `-o` you can create scripts to prepare your containers.
The scripts can mount filesystems, setup virtual network interfaces and more.
