Thanks to the contributed donations I was able to buy a Cubieboard2 and then
add the missing infrastructure to have a native Void image/rootfs.

The Cubieboard2 is a small low-cost device with the following specifications:

 - AllWinnerTech SOC A20，ARM® Cortex™-A7 Dual-Core ARM® Mali400 MP2 Complies with OpenGL ES 2.0/1.1
 - 1GB DDR3 @480M
 - 3.4GB internal NAND flash, up to 64GB on SD slot, up to 2T on 2.5 SATA disk
 - 5VDC input 2A or USB otg input
 - 1x 10/100 ethernet, support usb wifi
 - 2x USB 2.0 HOST, 1x mini USB 2.0 OTG, 1x micro sd
 - 1x HDMI 1080P display output
 - 1x IR, 1x line in, 1x line out
 - 96 extend pin interface, including I2C, SPI, RGB/LVDS, CSI/TS, FM-IN, ADC, CVBS, VGA, SPDIF-OUT, R-TP, and more

You can find the image for 2GB SD cards and the rootfs in the [downloads section](http://voidlinux.eu/#download)
