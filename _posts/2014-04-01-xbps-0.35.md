A new XBPS stable version has been released: 0.35. This is a minor release
that contains a new utility `xbps-uchroot` to be used by the XBPS source packages
collection (among other things).

Release notes:

- xbps-uchroot: new utility merged from xbps-packages/xbps-src that
uses linux namespaces to bind mount and chroot to a target directory.

- xbps-rindex(8): fixed a bug while signing repositories in that sometimes
the PEM RSA public key buffer contained unwanted garbage.

- Make sure that required root symlinks in void are never removed or detected
as obsoletes; added new test cases to stress the code works as expected.
